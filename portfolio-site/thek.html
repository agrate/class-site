    <h3>This work was created from many other smaller works I created in the spring of 2021. In one of my graphic design classes we were prompted to respond to Paul Thek's “Teaching Notes: 4-Dimensional Design.” I initially responded to these questions through writing. My second iterations were much more visual, but some pieces still included text. I then hand selected some of my second iterations, applied the same effect, and layered  them together to create this highly layered piece. This is by far my personal favorite piece.

    <h2> About me:</h2>

    <h4>I'm Amanda Grate and am a Graphic Design student at Virginia Commonwealth Univeristy. Along with my graphic skills I have a love for photography and mixed media, specifcally collages. I have an extremely deep appreciate for nature and focus a lot of my process and practice around that love. For my physical pieces I reuse receipts, paper bags, magazine clippings, and more used or found objects. I like to combine these elements with other supplies I already own. While I can't apply that specific process to my digital work, a lot of it is based around the evnrionment. That can be seen in my photography. I find the most inspiration in the natural elements of the earth and constantly seek out the unique.
