    <p>I started my plant collection at the begining of quaratine in March 2020. My trip to Lowes was my last outting for months and was the best place I could have gone. I bought 5 plants, sadly only 2 have survived. They have withstood drives back and forth from Richmond, VA to Montgomery, AL. They've stayed at a friend's house for a month and are still strong and healthy. My plants just like me have had 3 different residencies in the past year and a half, and my collection has only grown.</p>
